# AES-Image-Encryption
AES-based Image Encryption and Decryption Project for Cyber security and Digital forensics.

📖 Project Overview
This project implements **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** for secure **image encryption and decryption**.  
It demonstrates how cryptography can protect digital images from unauthorized access, ensuring data confidentiality.

 ## Objectives
- Encrypt images using AES algorithm
- Decrypt images using the same key
- Demonstrate practical cryptography applications
- Apply knowledge of cybersecurity and digital forensics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- AES Cryptographic Algorithm
- Programming Language: (e.g., Python / MATLAB / Java – replace with yours)
- Development Environment: macOS

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Select an input image
2. Generate AES encryption key
3. Encrypt the image using AES
4. Store the encrypted image
5. Decrypt the image using the same key to recover original
